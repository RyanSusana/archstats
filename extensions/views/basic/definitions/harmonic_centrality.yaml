  Harmonic centrality is a measure of centrality in a graph that takes into account the sum of the reciprocals of the shortest path distances from each component to all other components in the graph. It is a type of closeness centrality, which is a measure of how close a component is to all other components in the graph.

  The harmonic centrality of a component i is defined as:

  H(i) = Î£ 1/d(i,j)

  where d(i,j) is the shortest path distance between component i and component j, and the summation is over all other components j in the graph.

  Intuitively, components with high harmonic centrality are those that are close to many other components in the graph, and are therefore more central. 
  The harmonic centrality measure can be computed efficiently using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm for single-source shortest path, both of which have a time complexity of O(N^3) for a graph with N components.
  Overall, harmonic centrality is a measure of centrality that takes into account the distance between components in a graph, and can be useful in various applications where the cost of interaction or communication between components is related to the distance between them.
