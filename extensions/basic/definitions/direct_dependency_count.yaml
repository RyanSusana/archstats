name: Direct Dependency Count
short: |
  The direct dependency count of a component is measured by the number of other components it directly depends on.
long: |
    The direct dependency count of a component should be measured as an indicator of the amount of coupling between that component and other components.
    A component that has a high direct dependency count is more likely to be affected by changes to other components.
    A component that has a low direct dependency count is more likely to be stable and easy to maintain.
    The direct dependency count of a component should be balanced by its stability.
