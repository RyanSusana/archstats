id: abstractness
name: Abstractness
short: |
  The abstractness of a package is measured by the ratio of the number of abstract classes (and interfaces) it contains to the total number of classes in the package.
long: |
  The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a completely concrete package and A=1 indicating a completely abstract package.
  The abstractness of a package should be measured as an indicator of the amount of reuse possible for that package.
  Although it is not desirable to create packages that are not at all abstract, a package that is too abstract may be difficult to understand and maintain.
  The abstractness of a package should be balanced by its stability.
