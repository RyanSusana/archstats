id: abstractness
name: Abstractness
short: |
  The abstractness of a component is measured by the ratio of the number of abstract types (e.g. abstract classes or interfaces)
  it contains to the total number of types in the component.
long: |
  The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a completely concrete component and A=1 indicating a completely abstract component.
  The abstractness of a component should be measured as an indicator of the amount of reuse possible for that component.
  Although it is not desirable to create components that are not at all abstract, a component that is too abstract may be difficult to understand and maintain.
  The abstractness of a component should be balanced by its stability.
