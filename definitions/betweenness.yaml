  The importance of the component for the connectivity of the dependency graph.
full_description: |
  Betweenness centrality: This metric measures how often a node lies on the shortest path between pairs of other nodes 
  in a dependency graph. Nodes with high betweenness centrality are important for navigation because they serve as gateways 
  or bridges between different parts of the graph.

  For every pair of components in a graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the components such that either the number of edges that the path passes through 
  or the sum of the weights of the edges (for weighted graphs) is minimized. The betweenness centrality for each component is the number of these shortest 
  paths that pass through the component.
